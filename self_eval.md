# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
    - I am definitely most proud of how much work I was able to complete by myself today! I was definitely a little concerned that I would not be able to figure out a lot of things without needing help from my instructors or classmates but it seemed that a lot of it is all coming together in my mind! I do think I need some work on using the proper coding terms. I think I may have used quite a few incorrectly.  
- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
    - Methods are very powerful while writing code because they help give a specific set of instructions so that your code is knowing exactly what it is trying to achieve. Without the methods it would take much more time and thought proccesses to accieve what we are set out to do.
